        <h8>Project Description</h8>
        <p>
          This assignment involved building a timed quiz. The project required a
          timed quiz that would time out, close and the the user their results
          after a specified period of time.
        </p>

        <h8>Motivation</h8>
        <p>
          The motivation of the assignment is to make a game using JQuery
          principles. The developer will be able to see how JQuery commands help
          be logic in an application. The developer will be ablr to see more
          clearly the role of logic building using JQuery.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Results</h8>
        <p>
          At the end of this assignment the student will have designed a
          application quiz that will issue a quiz to the user. Give the user a
          click event button to start the quiz and the timer for the quiz. Once
          the quiz is completed then the quiz will timeout and give the user
          their score.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Challenges of the Project</h8>
        <p>
          The most challenging aspect of this assignment was to align the timer
          command, hide command and the display command together. Getting the
          page to align the actions of displaying the quiz title page to the
          user and then closing this page, diplaying the quiz and starting the
          timer were the most challenging aspects of this project.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Improvements</h8>
        <p>
          An improvement I would like to make on a similar project like this one
          might be dividing the questions into there own pages and timing each
          individual question. I would also have a main timer for the entire
          quiz as well.
