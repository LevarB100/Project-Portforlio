        <h8>Project Description</h8>
        <p>
          This application was aimed at a person who would what help deciding a
          food choice they are making. The application allows a person to search
          for different food choices and recieve recipes, nutritional
          information and even close restaraunts that serve the food choice
          being searched.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Motivation</h8>
        <p>
          The motivation behind this application was to consolidate as many
          helpful pieces of information surrounding a particular meal. This
          collection of information is meant to go along with and help assist
          the user accomplish their goal of acquiring whatever food they might
          be in the mood for.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Results</h8>
        <p>
          The results we achieved was an application that was light and
          friendly. The initial page had multiple food choices for the user to
          consider and a searchbar that the user could use to find information
          about what ever dish they were in the mood for. The user could easily
          find the nutritional fact, recipes and even the closest restaraunt
          that supplied the the particular meal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Team Efforts</h8>
        <p>
          The Team efforts and work were delegated amongst the group by the
          individual members deciding from the list of option we wanted for the
          application. The individual members listed features they wanted for
          the application. If the remaing group members agreed that the
          suggested feature was useful then the suggesting group member created
          the code for the feature.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Individual Responsibilities</h8>
        <p>
          The main responsibilities were as follows:
          <br />
          <h8>Farah Carter:</h8> HTML, CSS,Code Clean up
          <br />
          <h8>Levar Barrett:</h8> Restaurant feature code, Recipe feature code
          <br />
          <h8>Graeme Stewart:</h8> Nutritional Fact feature
          <br />
          <h8>Johnathan Johnson:</h8> Code clean up, Presentation script and
          PowerPoint
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Challenges of the Project</h8>
        <p>
          My main challenge during the production of this application was the
          coding involved. In the process of coding the feature for the
          restaurant locator I had to make multiple API requests to the same
          site in order to fully acquire the information i needed for the code.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Improvements</h8>
        <p>
          An improvement I would have made to this project was to try and make
          the code more streamlined. I would also like to add a database of some
          time into the application for certain dishes that a user my choose.
          Sometimes the search for dishes might not be as effective as a search
          for a genre of food.
