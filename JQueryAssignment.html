        <h8>Project Description</h8>
        <p>
          This assignment involved building a game that used 4 buttons with a
          randomly assigned number for each of the four numbers and aspecific
          number. The player is tasked to use the four random buttons to exactly
          equal the value of the assigned number.
        </p>

        <h8>Motivation</h8>
        <p>
          The motivation of the assignment is to make a game using JQuery
          principles. The developer will be able to see how JQuery commands help
          be logic in an application. The developer will be ablr to see more
          clearly the role of logic building using JQuery.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Results</h8>
        <p>
          At the end of this assignment the student will have designed a
          application game that fully resettable and capable of interacting
          fully and keeping score. The game should be capable of being played
          over a period of time while still keeping score and not having a
          glitch.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Challenges of the Project</h8>
        <p>
          The most challenging aspect of this assignment is to use the JQuery
          commands to build the logic of the program. Being able to see the
          logic isn't hard. The hard part is putting the logic into syntax code
          so the computer understands it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Improvements</h8>
        <p>
          An improvement I would like to make on a similar project like this one
          I might encounter would be to make the code more streamlined and
          simple. I believe the application could be made with much simplier
          code.
