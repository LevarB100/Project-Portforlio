        <h8>Project Description</h8>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project is for the student to gain experience
          making a portfoliothat is mobile-responsive. In this assignment the
          student will add code to a previously designed portfolio to make it
          responsive to the changing screen sizes used by users.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Motivation</h8>
        <p>
          The purpose of the project is to familarize the the student with the
          requirements of desinging an app to be responsive to the display
          mediums used by common users. The assignment is to taste the students
          pallets to the responsibility of making an app wide ranging into
          multiple markets.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Results</h8>
        <p>
          At the end of this assignment the student will have designed a
          portfolio that has the ability to change its display configuration
          depending on the screen size for which it is being displayed. The web
          page should remain readable no matter which screen it is being
          displayed on.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Challenges of the Project</h8>
        <p>
          The main challenge of this assignment is to learn the possible
          commands that make the app do the desired actions. The commands must
          be responsive towards a predetermined stimulus. Considering all the
          predetermined situations is very important.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Improvements</h8>
        <p>
          An improvement I would like to make on the next opportunity with a
          similar such assignment would be to learn more commands in order to be
          able to make the application even more responsive.
